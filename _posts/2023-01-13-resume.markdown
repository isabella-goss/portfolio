I am an early-career technical writer with two years of full-time software documentation experience and six years of professional writing experience.

I graduated in 2021 from North Carolina State University with a major in Graphics Communications and two minors: one in Technical and Scientific Communications and another in Science Communication. I'm the Swiss Army Knife of technical communicators: I can write succinct technical documentation, create crisp, well-defined technical drawings, and can code documentation sites (from scratch)!

In my free time, I enjoy baking, embroidery, and spending time with my son.

While my day job involves producing technical documentation, I haven't lost my spark for writing conversational, informal pieces!
